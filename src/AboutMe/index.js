        <p>
            I am interested in computers. I like to learn more about them and be able to code and develop things.
            This idea of being a builder is really cool. We really can do a lot of things if we have the will, persistence, some organization, and curiosity.

        <ul> Things I can add to this page: 
            <li>
                I could write a story and draw some stuff to put on this page in between the text. 
            </li>
            <li>
                I could add a my resume to this page. Or build a kind of interactive resume. Learn more about CSS and the effects I can do with it.
            </li>
            <li>
                I could link some external references like Github. I think though github would actually be the only thing I would link to. Maybe my attempt of a blog.
            </li>
